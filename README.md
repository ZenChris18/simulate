# simulate
1. create venv
2. install dependencies
3. run main.py

## change this to customize the simulation
### main.py
1. number_of_episodes - change this to how many time the agent tries the world
2. world_size - change this to change the world size "sizexsize"
### simulation.py
2. max_steps - change this to let the agent have how many steps in the world (make worldsize x 2 so steps can reach end to end of the world)


each episode the agent starts in a random place
